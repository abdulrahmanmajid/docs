## Voice Processing Pipeline

<Steps>
  <Step title="Audio Input">
    Raw audio is captured and preprocessed for optimal quality
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Speech Recognition">
    Audio is converted to text using ASR models
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Intent Analysis">
    System determines what the user wants to accomplish
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Context Processing">
    Current request is analyzed within conversation history
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Knowledge Retrieval">
    Relevant information is pulled from connected sources
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Response Formation">
    AI generates appropriate response using all available context
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Voice Synthesis">
    Text response is converted to natural-sounding speech
  </Step>
</Steps>
