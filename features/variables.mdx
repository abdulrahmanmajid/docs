Make your outbound calls personal by using variables! Variables are like placeholders that automatically fill in with your customer's information when the call starts.

## What Are Variables?

Think of variables as blank spaces in your message that get filled in with real information for each customer. It's like a template that becomes personalized for every call.

<Note>
Instead of saying "Hello customer", you can say "Hello {first_name}"! The agent will automatically use the customer's actual name.
</Note>

## Built-in Variables

These variables are always available - you don't need to set them up:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="call_id" icon="phone">
    The unique ID for each call
    ```text
    {call_id} → "C123456789"
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="agent_id" icon="user">
    Your AI agent's unique ID
    ```text
    {agent_id} → "A987654321"
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Creating Custom Variables

You can create your own variables when uploading your contact list. Here's how:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Your Contact List">
    Create a CSV file with your customer data. Include any information you want to use in calls:
    
    ```csv
    phone,first_name,appointment_time,service_type
    +1234567890,John,2pm tomorrow,haircut
    +0987654321,Sarah,3pm Friday,massage
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use Variables in Your Messages">
    When setting up your agent, use curly braces {} to insert variables:
    
    ```text
    "Hello {first_name}! I'm calling to remind you about your {service_type} 
    appointment scheduled for {appointment_time}."
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Preview How It Works">
    For John's call, the agent will say:
    ```text
    "Hello John! I'm calling to remind you about your haircut 
    appointment scheduled for 2pm tomorrow."
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Use Cases

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Appointment Reminders" icon="calendar">
    ```text
    "Hi {first_name}, just reminding you about your {service_type} tomorrow at {time}"
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Order Updates" icon="box">
    ```text
    "Hello {first_name}, your order #{order_id} will arrive on {delivery_date}"
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Payment Reminders" icon="credit-card">
    ```text
    "Hi {first_name}, your payment of ${amount} is due on {due_date}"
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Follow-ups" icon="reply">
    ```text
    "Hello {first_name}, following up on your recent {service_type} visit"
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Tips for Using Variables

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep It Natural" icon="comment">
    Write your messages how you would normally speak. Variables should fit naturally in the conversation:
    ```text
    Good: "Hello {first_name}, how are you today?"
    Bad: "CUSTOMER NAME: {first_name} - APPOINTMENT TIME: {time}"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test Before Launching" icon="vial">
    Always test your campaign with a few sample contacts first:
    - Make sure all variables are working
    - Check if the message sounds natural
    - Verify the information is correct
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Have Backups Ready" icon="shield">
    Sometimes information might be missing. Use friendly alternatives:
    ```text
    "Hello {first_name || 'there'}"
    // Will say "Hello there" if first_name is missing
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What You Can Include in Variables

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Names" icon="user">
    - First name
    - Last name
