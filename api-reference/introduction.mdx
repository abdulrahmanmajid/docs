# Kallabot AI API Documentation

Welcome to the Kallabot API documentation. Our comprehensive REST API enables you to programmatically create and manage AI voice agents for both inbound and outbound calling scenarios, providing a powerful platform for building automated voice interactions.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

Get started with the Kallabot API in minutes. Our API allows you to:
- Create and manage AI voice agents
- Handle inbound calls with intelligent routing
- Initiate outbound calls with customized scripts
- Monitor call analytics and performance

- Access call recordings and transcriptions
- Set up webhooks for real-time notifications

## ðŸ“‹ API Reference Structure

Our API is organized into logical groups for easy navigation:

- **Agents** - Create, manage, and configure AI voice agents
- **Calls** - Initiate and control voice calls
- **Campaigns** - Manage automated calling campaigns

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```bash
https://api.kallabot.com
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. You can obtain your API key from the [dashboard settings](https://app.kallabot.com/settings/api).

To authenticate your requests, include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key
```

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage:
- 100 requests per minute for standard accounts
- 1000 requests per minute for enterprise accounts

Rate limit information is included in the response headers:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Total requests allowed per window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the rate limit resets

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses will have a 2xx status code and follow this structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

Error responses include HTTP status codes in the 4xx or 5xx range and follow this format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "error_code",
    "message": "Human-readable error message",
    "details": {} // Additional error details when available
  }
}
```

## Versioning

The API uses semantic versioning. The current version is v1. We maintain backward compatibility within major versions.
