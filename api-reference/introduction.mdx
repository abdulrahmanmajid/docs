# Kallabot API Reference

Welcome to the Kallabot API reference documentation. Our API enables you to programmatically create and manage AI voice agents, handle calls, and integrate voice capabilities into your applications.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. You can get your API key from the [dashboard settings](https://app.kallabot.com/settings/api).
