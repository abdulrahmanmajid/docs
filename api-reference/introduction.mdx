# Kallabot API Reference

Welcome to the Kallabot API reference documentation. Our API enables you to programmatically create and manage AI voice agents for both inbound and outbound calling scenarios, providing a powerful platform for building automated voice interactions.

## Overview

Kallabot's API allows you to:
- Create and manage AI voice agents
- Handle inbound calls with intelligent routing
- Initiate outbound calls with customized scripts
- Monitor call analytics and performance
- Manage voice agent configurations
- Access call recordings and transcriptions
- Set up webhooks for real-time notifications

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```bash
https://api.kallabot.com/v1
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. You can obtain your API key from the [dashboard settings](https://app.kallabot.com/settings/api).

To authenticate your requests, include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key
```

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage:
- 100 requests per minute for standard accounts
- 1000 requests per minute for enterprise accounts

Rate limit information is included in the response headers:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Total requests allowed per window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the rate limit resets

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses will have a 2xx status code and follow this structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

Error responses include HTTP status codes in the 4xx or 5xx range and follow this format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "error_code",
    "message": "Human-readable error message",
    "details": {} // Additional error details when available
  }
}
```

## Versioning

The API uses semantic versioning. The current version is v1. We maintain backward compatibility within major versions.
