## Effects

When a campaign is deleted:
- Campaign record is removed from the database
- Redis flags are cleared
- Scheduled jobs are cancelled
- If `delete_contact_list=true`:
  - All contacts in the list are deleted
  - The contact list itself is deleted

| 404    | Campaign not found |
| 500    | Failed to delete campaign |

## Warning

<Warning>
  This operation is irreversible. Once a campaign is deleted, it cannot be recovered. If `delete_contact_list` is set to true, all associated contacts will also be permanently deleted.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

1. Always confirm before deleting a campaign
2. Consider archiving campaigns instead of deleting them
3. Back up contact lists before deletion if they might be needed later
4. Use `delete_contact_list=true` only when you're certain the contact list won't be needed for other campaigns
