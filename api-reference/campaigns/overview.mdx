# Campaigns

Campaigns allow you to automate outbound calls to a list of contacts using your configured AI voice agents. They provide a scalable way to reach multiple contacts while maintaining control over timing and execution.

## Key Features

### Scheduled Execution
- Schedule campaigns to start at specific times
- Support for different timezones
- Automatic handling of overdue campaigns

### Contact Management
- Call multiple contacts sequentially
- Configurable delay between calls
- Automatic tracking of call results

### Campaign Control
- Pause and resume capabilities
- Real-time status monitoring
- Detailed call statistics

## Campaign States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| pending | Campaign is scheduled but not yet started |
| overdue | Campaign's scheduled time has passed but it hasn't started |
| running | Campaign is actively making calls |
| completed | All calls in the campaign have been completed |
| failed | Campaign encountered an error during execution |
| paused | Campaign has been manually paused |

## Campaign Lifecycle

1. **Creation**
   - Campaign is created with a schedule and contact list
   - System validates agent and contact list
   - Campaign is set to "pending" state

2. **Execution**
   - At scheduled time, campaign moves to "running" state
   - System begins making calls to contacts
   - Each call result is recorded

3. **Completion**
   - Campaign moves to "completed" when all calls are done
   - Final statistics are calculated
   - Results are available for review
