  "name": "Q1 Sales Campaign",
  "status": "running",
  "progress": {
    "total": 100,
    "completed": 45,
    "failed": 2,
    "pending": 53
  },
  "timing": {

## Progress Calculation

The progress fields are calculated as follows:
- `total`: Total number of contacts in the campaign
- `completed`: Number of successful calls
- `failed`: Number of failed calls
- `pending`: `total - (completed + failed)`

## Timezone Handling

- All timestamps in the database are stored in UTC
- The `scheduled_for` time is converted to the campaign's configured timezone
- Other timestamps remain in UTC format
