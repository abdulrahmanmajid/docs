## Campaign States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| pending | Campaign is scheduled but not yet started |
| overdue | Campaign's scheduled time has passed but it hasn't started |
| running | Campaign is actively making calls |
| completed | All calls in the campaign have been completed |
| failed | Campaign encountered an error during execution |
| paused | Campaign has been manually paused |

## Effects

When a campaign is created:
- Contact list is validated to ensure it's not empty
- Scheduled time is converted to UTC for storage
- Campaign is scheduled for automatic execution
- If scheduled time has passed, campaign starts immediately
- Each contact will be called sequentially with specified delay
- Call results are tracked in the database

## Errors

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 400    | Contact list is empty |
| 401    | Invalid or missing API key |
| 403    | Agent is configured for inbound calls only |
| 404    | Agent not found |
| 404    | Contact list not found |
| 500    | Failed to create campaign |
