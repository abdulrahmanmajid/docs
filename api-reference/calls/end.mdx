    "status": "completed",
    "duration": 145,
    "recording_url": "https://api.kallabot.com/v1/recordings/rec_01H1V1J3K4M5N6P7Q8R9S0T1U2"

## Termination Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[End Request] --> B{Validate Call}
    B -->|Not Found| C[Return Error]
    B -->|Found| D{Check Status}
    D -->|Not Active| E[Return Error]
    D -->|Active| F[Stop Agent]
    F --> G[End Twilio Call]
    G --> H[Update Records]
    H --> I[Process Recording]
    I --> J[Send Webhooks]
    J --> K[Return Response]
```

## Effects

When a call is ended:
- Active conversation is terminated
- Agent is released and marked as available
- Call status is updated in the database
- Call duration is calculated and stored
- Recording is finalized (if enabled)
- Webhooks are triggered
- Resources are cleaned up

## Validation

Before ending a call, the system checks:
- Call exists
- Call belongs to account
- Call is currently active
- User has permission to end call

## Errors

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 400    | Invalid call ID format |
| 401    | Invalid or missing API key |
| 403    | Insufficient permissions |
| 404    | Call not found |
| 409    | Call already ended |
| 500    | Internal server error |

## Best Practices

1. Verify call ID before ending
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Listen for webhooks to confirm termination
4. Handle recording URLs appropriately
5. Update UI/UX to reflect call status
6. Log termination reasons for analytics

## Webhooks

The following events will trigger webhooks:
- call.ending
- call.ended
- recording.available (if recording was enabled)

## Warning

<Warning>
  - Call termination is immediate and cannot be undone
  - Any ongoing conversation will be stopped
  - Make sure to handle any cleanup in your application
  - Recording processing may continue after call ends
</Warning>
